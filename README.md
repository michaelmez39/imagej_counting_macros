## Macros for automated cell counting
The `process1.txt` file has the start of a macro that automates the manual cell counting process.

See the [imagej macro documentation](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/macros.html) for more!

Some additional features we may want to add could guess the size of the particles. Also, we may want to filter a certain color out of the image.

Also, we may want to change some of the default options when we run a command, like this [example https://imagej.nih.narkive.com/9lJKFAIQ/macro-command-with-default-options](https://imagej.nih.narkive.com/9lJKFAIQ/macro-command-with-default-options)
